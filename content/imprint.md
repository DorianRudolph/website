This website does not collect, store or process Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and does not require the use of cookies.
If the user contacts me (for example via the above email), only the data necessary to facilitate communication will be stored.

This website is hosted on third party servers (Github Pages).
Therefore, it is necessary for a third party to process the user's IP address, which otherwise could not send content to the user's browser.
